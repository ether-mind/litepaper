# Chapter 2: Technical Architecture

#### Blockchain Infrastructure

EtherMind will utilize Ethereum for its mature ecosystem and smart contract capabilities. Depending on transaction cost and speed requirements, Eclipse/Fuel/Solana/NEAR might be considered for its low fees and scalability. Smart contracts will handle transactions, user registration, and AI model listings.

#### Decentralized Storage and Execution

To ensure availability and integrity, AI models and datasets will be stored using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). Secure, decentralized computing platforms like Golem or iExec will be used for model training and execution, allowing users to run AI models without compromising their computational resources.

#### User Interface and Security

The front end will be built using Next.js, with Tailwind CSS for UI design and Web3.js or Ethers.js for blockchain interactions. Decentralized Identifiers (DID) will be implemented for secure and verifiable user identities, and regular security audits and encryption will safeguard sensitive data.
